# Single-Image-Super-Resolution
This is as close as possible an implementation of the paper **Image Super-Resolution Using very deep Residual Channel Attention Networks**. Link to the paper - **https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02758**. </br>I have only implemented perceptual loss and left out adversarial loss. Also, 2 layers have been shaved off due to hardware contraints. 

## TO-DO 
Train the model
